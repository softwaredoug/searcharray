# SearchArray 

[![Python package](https://github.com/softwaredoug/searcharray/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/softwaredoug/searcharray/actions/workflows/test.yml) | Discuss at [Relevance Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/relevancy/shared_invite/zt-2ccxvzn1w-2_50zf9xBOSv3n06Cu15jg)

SearchArray turns Pandas string columns into a term index. It alows efficient BM25 / TFIDF scoring of phrases and individual tokens.

Think Lucene, but as a Pandas column.

```python
from searcharray import SearchArray
import pandas as pd

df['title_indexed'] = SearchArray.index(df['title'])
np.sort(df['title_indexed'].array.score('Cat'))

> BM25 scores:
> array([ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        , ..., 15.84568033, 15.84568033, 15.84568033])
```

## Docs | Guide

SearchArray is documented in these notebooks:

## Installation

```
pip install searcharray
```

## Motivation

To simplify lexical search in the Python data stack.

Many ML / AI practitioners reach for a vector search solution, then realize they need to sprinkle in some degree of BM25 / lexical search. Let's get traditional full-text search to behave like other parts of the data stack.

SearchArray creates a Pandas-centric way of creating and using a search index as just part of a Pandas array. In a sense, it builds a search engine in Pandas - to allow anyone to prototype ideas and perform reranking, without external systems.

IE, let's take a dataframe that has a bunch of text, like movie title and overviews:

```
In[1]: df = pd.DataFrame({'title': titles, 'overview': overviews}, index=ids)
Out[1]:
                                        title                                           overview

Index the text:

```
In[2]: df['title_indexed'] = SearchArray.index(df['title'])
       df

Out[2]:
                                        title                                           overview                                      title_indexed

```

(notice the dumb tokenization - no worries you can pass your own tokenizer).

Then search, getting top N with `Cat`

```
In[3]: np.sort(df['title_indexed'].array.score('Cat'))
Out[3]: array([ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        , ..., 15.84568033,
                15.84568033, 15.84568033])

In[4]: df['title_indexed'].score('Cat').argsort()
Out[4]: 

array([0, 18561, 18560, ..., 15038, 19012,  4392])
```

And since its just pandas, we can, of course just retrieve the top matches

```
In[5]: df.iloc[top_n_cat[-10:]]
Out[5]:
                  title                                           overview                                      title_indexed

## Goals 

The overall goals are to recreate a lot of the lexical features (term / phrase search) of a search engine like Solr or Elasticsearch, but in a Pandas dataframe. 

### Memory efficient and fast text index

We want the index to be as memory efficient and fast at searching as possible. We want using it to have a minimal overhead.

We want you to be able to work with a reasonable dataset (100X-1M docs) relatively efficiently for offline evaluation. And 1000s for fast reranking in a service.

### Experimentation, reranking, functionality over scalability

Instead of building for 'big data' our goal is to build for *small-data*. That is, focus on capabilities and expressiveness of Pandas, over limiting functionality in favor of scalability.

To this end, the applications of searcharray will tend to be focused on experimentation and top N candidate reranking. For experimentation, we want any ideas expressed in Pandas to have a somewhat clear path / "contract" in how they'd be implemented in a classical lexical search engine. For reranking, we want to load some top N results from a base system and be able to modify them.

### Make lexical search compatible with the data stack

We know in search, RAG, and other retrieval problems [hybrid search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/hybrid-search-intro/) techniques dominate. Yet often its cast in terms of a giant, weird, big data lexical search engine that looks odd to most data scientists being joined with a vector database. We want lexical search to be more approachable to data scientists and ML engineers building these systems.

## Non-goals

### You need to bring your own tokenization

Python libraries [already do tokenization really well](https://github.com/snowballstem). Even exceeding what Lucene can do... giving you the ability to simulate and/or exceed the abilities of Lucene's tokenization.

In SearchArray, a tokenizer is a function takes a string and emits a series of tokens. IE dumb, default whitespace tokenization:

```python
def ws_tokenizer(string):
    return string.split()
```

And you can pass any tokenizer that matches this signature to index:

```python
def ws_lowercase_tokenizer(string):
    return string.lower().split()

df['title_indexed'] = SearchArray.index(df['title'], tokenizer=ws_lowercase_tokenizer)
```

Create your own using stemming libraries, or whatever Python functionality you want.

### Use Pandas instead of function queries

Solr has its [own unique function query syntax]()https://solr.apache.org/guide/7_7/function-queries.html. Elasticsearch has [Painless](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-painless.html).

Instead of recreating these, simply use Pandas on existing Pandas columns. Then later, if you need to implement this in Solr or Elasticsearch, attempt to recreate the functionality. Arguably what's in Solr / ES would be a subset of what you could do in Pandas.

```
# Calculate the number of hours into the past
df['hrs_into_past'] = (now - df['timestamp']).dt.total_seconds() / 3600
```

Then multiply by BM25 if you want:

```
df['score'] = df['title_indexed'].score('Cat') * df['hrs_into_past']
```

### Vector search

We focus on the lexical, ie "BM25-ish" and adjacent problems. There are other great tools for vector search out there.

## TODOs / Future Work / Known issues

* Always more efficient
* Support tokenizers with overlapping positions (ie synonyms, etc)
* Improve support for phrase slop
* Helper functions (like [this start at edismax](https://github.com/softwaredoug/searcharray/blob/main/searcharray/solr.py) that help recreate Solr / Elasticsearch lexical queries)
* Fuzzy search
* Efficient way to "slurp" some top N results from retrieval system into a dataframe
